### In Canvas, answer the following questions:

- Which resource did you choose to use?

![Join Quiz](./screenshots/JoinQuiz.png)

![Join Quiz 2](./screenshots/JoinQuiz2.png)

- What are three things you learned during this lab?

I learned that DISTINCT removes any duplicate rows.

I also learned you can JOIN more than one table at a time.

Finally, I learned that you can JOIN tables without showing the values/columns you are joining them on.
